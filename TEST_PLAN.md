# Test Plan for SauceDemo Automation Testing

## Overview
This test plan outlines the approach for automated testing of the **SauceDemo** application using **Playwright** in JavaScript. The purpose of this test plan is to ensure the quality, performance, and reliability of the web application through comprehensive testing strategies.

- **Project Name**: SauceDemo Automation Testing
- **Test Framework**: Playwright (JavaScript)
- **Environment**: SauceDemo website (https://www.saucedemo.com)

## Types of Testing
The following types of testing will be performed:

- **Smoke Testing**: Verify the basic functionalities after each deployment.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the performance of the application under different conditions.
- **End-to-End Testing (E2E)**: Simulate real-user workflows to ensure everything works correctly.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Manually test edge cases and unexpected user behaviors.
- **Usability Testing**: Check the user interface and user experience.

## Test Strategy

### Smoke Testing
**Objective**: Ensure critical functionality works after a deployment.

#### Test Scenarios:
- **Valid Login**: Ensure users can log in with valid credentials.
- **Invalid Login**: Ensure users see an error message with invalid credentials.
- **Add to Cart**: Verify that users can add products to the cart.
- **Remove from Cart**: Verify that users can remove products from the cart.
- **Logout**: Verify that users can log out successfully and are redirected to the login page.

---

### Regression Testing
**Objective**: Ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.

#### Test Scenarios:
- **Login (Valid/Invalid)**: Re-test login functionality.
- **Cart Operations**: Ensure the cart behaves as expected (add, remove, update items).
- **Checkout Process**: Test that users can proceed through the checkout process without issues.
- **Sorting**: Verify sorting by name and price works properly.
- **Responsive Design**: Test the app on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Logout**: Verify the logout functionality.

---

### Performance Testing
**Objective**: Evaluate the app’s performance under different conditions.

#### Test Scenarios:
- **Page Load Time**: Measure the load time of home, product, and cart pages.
- **Concurrent Users**: Simulate multiple users adding items to the cart and completing checkout.
- **API Latency**: Measure the API response time for login, cart operations, and checkout.
- **Stress Testing**: Test how the application handles high traffic or requests.

---

### End-to-End Testing (E2E)
**Objective**: Ensure the full user flow from login to checkout works correctly.

#### Test Scenarios:
- **Valid Login → Add to Cart → Checkout**: Simulate a user journey from login to purchasing products.
- **Invalid Login → Error Handling**: Ensure the application correctly handles failed logins.
- **Remove Item from Cart → Checkout**: Test the flow where a user removes items and still completes checkout.
- **Product Sorting**: Verify the sorting options (price, name) work correctly.
- **Responsive Design**: Test the full flow on different screen sizes.

---

### Exploratory Testing
**Objective**: Manually test for unexpected behaviors and edge cases.

#### Test Scenarios:
- **Edge Cases**: Test unusual input cases (e.g., long product names, special characters in the username).
- **Broken Links**: Ensure all links are functional and lead to the correct pages.
- **Session Timeout**: Verify how the app behaves when a user session expires.
- **UI Behavior**: Test UI components for correctness and responsiveness across browsers.

---

### Usability Testing
**Objective**: Ensure the app is user-friendly and accessible.

#### Test Scenarios:
- **Navigation**: Verify that users can easily navigate between pages and categories.
- **Visual Design**: Ensure consistency in design and layout (buttons, colors, fonts).
- **Accessibility**: Check for accessibility issues such as missing ARIA labels and poor color contrast.
- **Error Messages**: Validate that error messages are clear and helpful.

---

## Test Execution Strategy

- **Test Environment**: Tests will be run on the **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and **Edge** browsers, as well as on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Automation**: Playwright will be used to automate all tests. GitHub Actions will be set up for CI/CD to run tests on each commit.
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests will be executed in parallel to speed up execution times.
- **Test Reporting**: **Allure** or **Jest** will be used to generate detailed test reports.

---

## Risk and Mitigation Plan

- **Flaky Tests**: Some tests may fail intermittently due to network instability or timing issues.
  - **Mitigation**: Use retries or stabilize actions (e.g., waiting for elements to be visible before interacting).
  
- **Performance Degradation**: The application might degrade under heavy load.
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct performance testing regularly and optimize the app for high traffic.
  
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Tests might need to be updated frequently due to UI changes.
  - **Mitigation**: Keep tests modular, simple, and easy to update. Implement a clear test structure.

---

## Test Deliverables

- **Test Plan Document**: This document will serve as the official guide for all testing activities.
- **Test Case Descriptions**: Detailed test cases will be documented.
- **Execution Logs**: Logs of each test run with pass/fail status.
- **Test Reports**: Summary reports showing the status of test execution.

---

## Conclusion

This test plan ensures that all major functionalities of the **SauceDemo** application are properly tested. By following this plan, we can achieve high confidence in the reliability, performance, and usability of the site.

---

## Next Steps

- **Setup CI/CD**: Integrate tests with GitHub Actions for automatic test execution on every commit.
- **Organize Test Suites**: Organize Playwright tests into logical folders (e.g., `smoke`, `regression`, `e2e`).
- **Track Results**: Monitor test results and ensure proper issue tracking and reporting.
